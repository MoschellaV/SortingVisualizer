## 📄 About The Project
I created this project to allow others to better see how popular sorting algorthims work, they're also _really satisfying_ to watch.

<br/>

### 🚀 Features

- **Sorting algorithm visualization:** Watch various sorting algorithms sort an array in real-time.
- **Array customization:** Customize the size of the array to be sorted to see how algorithms perform on different inputs.
- **Speed adjustment:** Control the speed of the visualization to observe the sorting process at different rates.
- **Algorithm selection:** Choose from a list of available sorting algorithms to visualize their specific behavior and efficiency.
- **Color-coded visualization:** Algorithm steps are seperated by different colours making it easier to distinguish between sorting steps.

### 💻 Tech Used
The website is built using the following tech:

- [**React:**](https://react.dev/) Used for building the user interface, providing a modular and component-based approach.
- [**JavaScript**:](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript) Used for implementing the sorting algorithms and manipulating the DOM.
- [**Mantine:**](https://mantine.dev/) UI library used for styling and enhancing the the user interface.

### 🧠 What I Learned
Making this project I deepened my understanding of sorting algorithms and their implementations. Although I was already familiar with React and its concepts, I gained a lot of knowledge learning how to write code for the various algorithms. This project was pretty fun as it let me enhance my problem-solving skills as I had to translate algorithmic logic into functional code. I also analyzed each algorithms efficiency, and optimized the sorting process. Overall, this project gave me a well-rounded understanding of sorting algorithms and their practical implementation.
